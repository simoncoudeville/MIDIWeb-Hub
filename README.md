[MIDIWeb Hub](https://5of12.github.io/MIDIWeb-Hub/) is a curated, community-driven directory of websites that support **[WebMIDI](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmidi/)**.

It exists to help musicians, makers, educators, developers, and curious internet explorers discover the growing ecosystem of browser-based musical tools — from synths and sequencers to MIDI utilities, experiments, educational tools, and playful oddities!

MIDIWeb Hub is also a companion to **[MIDIWeb](https://midiweb.cc)**, a browser for Apple platforms designed to make it easier to explore WebMIDI on **iPhone, iPad, macOS, and visionOS**.

## Why make a directory of WebMIDI Sites!?

WebMIDI opens up a wonderful corner of the web: sites that can communicate directly with MIDI devices and software!

That means your browser can do more than just browse... It can become a synth editor, a sequencer, a controller surface, a musical playground, a teaching tool, or a bridge between hardware and online experiences.

MIDIWeb Hub exists to:

- help people discover useful WebMIDI websites
- make browser-based music tools easier to find and share
- celebrate the ecosystem of creative musical websites
- encourage more developers to build for the open web
  promote the movement towards [MIDI 2.0](https://midi.org/midi-2-0) and [WebMIDI 2.0](https://midi.org/new-midi-2-0-transports-ble-web-midi-and-transport-remote-management)
- support the broader MIDIWeb platform and community

## What is WebMIDI?

**WebMIDI** refers to the **Web MIDI API**, a web technology that allows websites to send and receive MIDI data using compatible browsers and devices.

In practical terms, that means a website can talk to synthesizers, MIDI controllers, drum machines, DAWs, and other MIDI-capable tools — all from within the browser.

WebMIDI makes it possible to build music tools that are easy to access, easy to share, and often require little or no installation.

## How do I view WebMIDI websites?

### On desktop

To use WebMIDI websites on desktop, you will generally need:

- a [**WebMIDI-capable browser**](https://webmidijs.org/docs/getting-started/)
- a connected MIDI device or MIDI software setup
- permission for the site to access MIDI devices when prompted

Depending on your setup, this may include physical USB or Bluetooth MIDI hardware, or virtual MIDI routing between apps.

### On iPhone, iPad and visionOS

WebMIDI support on Apple platforms has historically been limited.

If you want to explore WebMIDI websites on **iPhone, iPad, or Apple Vision Pro**, consider downloading **[MIDIWeb](https://midiweb.cc)** — a browser built for Web MIDI on Apple devices.

Learn more at **[midiweb.cc](https://midiweb.cc)**.

## What kind of sites belong here?

We’re interested in useful, interesting, (and working!) websites that use WebMIDI in some meaningful way, including:

- browser synths and instruments
- sequencers and drum machines
- MIDI monitors and diagnostic tools
- educational tools
- patch editors and librarians
- controller interfaces
- generative music tools
- interactive musical experiments

**If it’s musical, browser-based, and speaks MIDI, it probably belongs here!**

## Community-driven directory

This project is intended to be **community driven**.

We welcome contributions from the community! To add a new WebMIDI-capable website to the directory, please submit a Pull Request to our GitHub repository.

Add your site using the following format:

```json
{
  "id": "your-site-id",
  "name": "Your Site Name",
  "url": "https://yoursite.com",
  "tags": ["synth", "webaudio"],
  "description": "A short description of your site."
}
```

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository at **[github.com/5of12/midiweb-hub](https://github.com/5of12/midiweb-hub)**
2. Add your site to the `src/data.ts` file using the format above
3. Commit your changes and push to your fork
4. Open a Pull Request with a brief description of the site

## Submission guidelines

To keep the directory useful, please try to ensure submissions are:

- relevant to WebMIDI
- publicly accessible
- stable and working
- clearly described

A few practical suggestions:

- use a short, unique `id`
- prefer lowercase tags where possible
